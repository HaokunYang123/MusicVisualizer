# Music Visualizer ðŸŽµâœ¨

A dynamic music visualization application that creates stunning particle-based visual effects synchronized with audio input from either your microphone or web audio. The visualizer responds to beat detection and audio frequencies to create an immersive and interactive experience.

## Features

- Real-time audio processing from microphone or web audio input
- Dynamic particle system that responds to music beats and frequencies
- Beautiful visual effects synchronized with audio
- Beat detection algorithm for precise rhythm visualization
- Smooth particle animations and transitions
- Interactive user controls for customization

## Technologies

- Web Audio API for audio processing
- Canvas/WebGL for particle rendering
- Real-time audio analysis
- Dynamic particle physics system

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser with Web Audio API support
